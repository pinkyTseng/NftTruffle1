# NFT project based on OpenZeppelin

This project is the NFT project based on OpenZeppelin build with Truffle, and the resources are stored at IPFS. The project complies with the ERC721 standard and can be discovered and traded on the Opensea platform. It is based on the OpenZeppelin ERC721Enumerable and implements some features that I observe and feel are important. The features are listed below.

- It should be mintable.
- It should set up the total supply.
- It should be set whether to sell or not now.
- It should can pause when some critical situation happens.
- It should can be revealed.(blind box feature)
- The contract's builder can withdraw tocken from contract.
- It should set up the max count when the user mints each time.
- It should set up the max count each user owns.
- Undoubtedly many operations are performed only by the contract owner.
